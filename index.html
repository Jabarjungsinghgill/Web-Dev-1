        <h1>WHAT IS WEB DEVELOPMENT AND DATABASE ?</h1>

        <p> The database is the central repository for all of this data. Web applications use a variety of databases to
            store
            data such as flat files, relational databases, object-relational databases, and NoSQL databases. Each type
            of database
            has its own advantages and disadvantages when it comes to storing and retrieving data.Databases store vast
            amounts of
            data that power websites and web applications.They allow web developers to organise data in logical
            structures and
            retrieve it quickly and efficiently when needed.Databases also allowusers to easily search and filter data
            to find specific information.

        <h1> HOW WEB APPLICATIONS INTERACT WITH BACK END DATABASES ?</h1>

        <p> <h2>Essentially, developers can communicate with databases by writing queries to access data, change tables, and
            more. In turn, APIs allow communication
            between an application and a database management system. Overall, APIs allow developers to talk to a
            database and extract information.</h2>
        </p>

        <P>
            <h2> Here is the key things to know about the connection between databases and APIs:</h2>

            1. A database is an organized collection of information, used by organizations to store, maintain, and access
            data, aiding in informed business decisions.

            <br>
            <br>

            2. Databases improve business processes, track customer data, and help keep data secure through proper security
            measures like controlled access, encryption, and anonymization.
            
            <br>
            <br>

            3. Common types of databases include relational, object-oriented, centralized, distributed, NoSQL,
            hierarchical, network, and cloud databases.
            
            <br>
            <br>

            4. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) enable communication between software components, acting as
            translators or middlemen, with common types being REST APIs and SOAP APIs, as well as browser and
            iOS/Android APIs.
            
            <br>
            <br>

            5. APIs facilitate communication between applications and databases, supporting cloud computing, working with
            any type of database, and adding a layer of protection to databases.<br>

        <h1>WHY WEB DEVELOPMENT AND DATABASE IS IMPORTANT ?</h1>
        <br>
        <h1>7 Reasons Why Web Development Is Important for All Types of Businesses.</h1>

        <br>

        <p>

            1. Full Design Control

            Your company may change or adjust the range of products you provide, pricing policy (holiday discounts,
            etc.) or even company structure, which you need to reflect on your page. Owning a website allows much more
            detailed customizations, as compared to using a landing page.
            <br>
            <br>

            2. Increasing Brand Awareness

            Having a website allows adding a favicon to the page, creating RSS-feed to keep your audience tuned on
            latest updates, using comments to gather valuable customer feedback and replying to it, posting links to
            your site at forums and blogs. Many additional tools allow increasing brand awareness and customer pool.
            <br>
            <br>
        

            3. Saving Money on Advertising

            Instead of paying for expensive offline and online ads, you can invest into SEO-promotion of your own page,
            which brings lasting results, as the funds you spend to promote your own page are the funds well spent.
            However, please do not mistake paid traffic Rudy Mendoza mentioned with investment into high-quality
            content, responsive website design, market trends analysis and well-thought special offers.

            <br>
            <br>

            4. Saving Time on Asking Questions

            Whenever your customers need to know something about your business, having a contact form, a live chat, an
            option to comment or a phone number is a step towards them, which increases a possibility of sealing the
            deal.
            <br>
            <br>

            5. Confirming Your Credibility

            Everybody understands that building a professional website involves some serious investment, which most
            likely means the company is not going to disappear the next day, so the customers are more prone to order
            from you.
            <br>
            <br>

            6. Referral Programs and Discounts

            Having your own page allows implementing a referral program or issuing discounts to your customers through
            the billing system. This is a feature free ad boards and social network groups cannot provide.
            <br>
            <br>

            7. Your Website Works 247

            Ticket system allows accepting and invoicing orders even if you arenâ€™t in the office, meaning that the
            website can earn money while you sleep.
